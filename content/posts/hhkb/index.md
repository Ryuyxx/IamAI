## ðŸ”–TL DR
- Bought a [new keyboard](https://hhkeyboard.us/happyhacking/pro-hybrid-type-s/)âœ¨.
- Quite expensive($350), but worth it.
- The keystrokes feel too good.

<br><br>

## Why

Remote meetings have increased due to COVID-19.  
I often take notes on Notion, etc., but I began to feel that my typing sound was kinda loud.
In fact, I had a friend record a conversation with me to check it out, and it was loud.  
This is why I switched to a new keyboard.

<br><br>

## Answer

In conclusion, my newly purchased keyboard is [HHKB type-s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Hacking_Keyboard).  
Actually, I was originally using HHKB. In other words, I simply changed the model.

<br><br>

### Changes

<div style="text-align: center; color: white;">

    <a href="https://amzn.to/3w3Gbf0">HHKB Professional HYBRID Type-S US White</a>
</div>
<br>

There are three types of HHKBs, and the one I've owned so far was a medium one. This time, I bought the high-end quiet model, and this is awesome.  
What's good about it is its **quietness**, and the fact that it is **wireless**.  

<br><br>

### my fave.

The keyboard layout and other functional aspects are worth the price($350). 
However, what I'd like to mention is the keystroke feel. I'll say it again and again.  
**The keystroke feeling is godlike**.

Honestly, you can't feel it in the video, but you should still watch the video. And please buy it.

<br><br>

## Thoughts

- If you have a solid Bluetooth receiver, there will be no delay.
- Wireless is by far the most beautiful.
- The HHKB type-s is very quiet but comfortable. 
- If you've ever struggled with various keyboard switches, choose **Topre electrostatic capacitive key switches**.
- Please forgive me. I'm excited and incoherent.
