## Hi There :wave:

Finally, I created a blog.  
Well, I don't really have anything to write about.  
But, I thought it would be interesting to keep a record of it in something.  
I'm sure I'll be laughing when I look back at this after I've become a true adult.

## Now :new_moon:

The virus has everyone holed up in their rooms. (I'm happy).  
This has given me more things to want.
I want a camera, an electric standing desk, and a good bed...  
Also whatever, my current MacBook(Retina, 12-inch, 2017) is way slow.  
I'm interested in the recently released and popular [M1 MacBook](https://www.apple.com/mac/m1/).  
**I want a stout laptop.**

{{< admonition note "self" false >}}
Now, I can only code childish and there are so much stuff I want to do that I can't focus on one thing.   
Time is limited, so I want to handle it efficiently.  
Luckily, I have a few skilled engineers around me. I want to cherish them.

## Theme

Some of you are probably wondering what I'm using for the theme of this site.
>I'm using [LoveIt](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt) by [dillonzq](https://github.com/dillonzq).  

Unfortunately, this project is abandoned and some bugs have been found.  
Some people have forked this and keep updating, so if you are interested, I suggest you to use them.
