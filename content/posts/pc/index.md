## Intro
- In this article, I would like to introduce my current **PC** and **desk setup**.  
- I don't think I will make any more significant improvements while I am at family home. (I can't wait to live on my own.)
- In addition, I would like to introduce some of the PCs I have built in the past.

## Setup :information_desk_person:
<br>
{{< figure src="https://bit.ly/2YYsejs" title="Desk (2019~) " >}}

I've been in this environment for about two years.
Personally, I think it's getting more sophisticated.   
I used to play games, but recently I realized that my gaming time is wasted.  
I'll describe the details briefly below.

### Gear
- 160x160 L-Shaped Desk
- [LG 5120x2160 34inch Monitor](https://amzn.to/3d0uPBF)
- [Ergotron Monitor Arm](https://amzn.to/370bk8x)
- [Sound Blaster X Katana](https://amzn.to/36Vz5Ph)
- [Majestouch 2SS](https://amzn.to/3cZTYNa) / MX Speed Silver switch / Tenkeyless / US ASCII
- [Logitech MX Master 3](https://amzn.to/2Z49C1S)
- [SHURE SM7B](https://amzn.to/2Z6HyKU)
- [RODE PSA1](https://amzn.to/2Z3lmS6) (Recommend [Blue Microphone Stand Compass](https://amzn.to/2OprMcd))
- [Roland Rubix24](https://amzn.to/3aVqJYS)
- Random [lights](https://amzn.to/3b6UqGT) and [mousepad](https://amzn.to/3tMKPgT)

I'm planning to change the keyboard as I've noticed I prefer to use heavy keys or a low profile.

This was assembled by me in November 2020.  
I've been building gaming PCs for a while and I'm tired of it. From now on, I am planning to challenge how to build a high-end PC in a small size. This is one of those challenges.  
I am proud to say that the size is quite compact. As you can see from the picture, I spent a lot of time on the wiring.  
I personally like to keep my wiring clean, so I use a lot of ties to ensure a certain level of maintainability.

Initially, I was concerned about the power capacity. In fact, the power supply seems a bit lacking.I realize that the lack of power supply is probably causing the low performance.  
Naturally, it will outperform the others in benchmarking, but it will not be able to deliver 100% performance.  
I'm considering replacing my power supply with a [1000w SFX](https://bit.ly/2MGUvJ7) size power supply by SilverStone which is going to release soon(?).  
Also, I'm considering water-cooling, but since I don't have the money for it, it will probably be a while.

## Legacy :see_no_evil:

These are the legacies of the past. So far I have assembled these computers.

I miss the days when I used to be happy with [core i7](https://amzn.to/3cVucJT).  Now my body craves more cores and is not satisfied with less than 24GB of VRAM:cold_sweat:  

I'm also using a 2017 MacBook right now. But it's too slow and planning to move on a new laptop. I'll write something about it soon after I buy.
