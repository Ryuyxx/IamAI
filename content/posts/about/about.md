## What's ROG  
ROG is the name of this website.    
Originally, I was going to use `Ryuya's log`.  
However, that would be too long and I basically like short names, so I invented an abbreviation.
The history of the changes are as follows.
{{< admonition info "origin" false >}}
1. `Ryuya's log`
2. `Ryuyalog`
3. `R(L)og`
4. `ROG`
{{< /admonition >}}
I know that ROG is a [gaming brand of ASUS](https://rog.asus.com/). Actually, I love ASUS and it's one of my favorite brands. Miraculously, it came across the same name, so I am using it as the name of this website. (I'll change it if there are any copyright issues)

Some people may wonder the Chinese displayed on the header.  
`龍的成長日記` means `Dragon's Growth Diary`.  
My real name `Ryuya` is written in Japanese as `竜也` which means dragon.  
That's why I gave this name to the title.
